## My name is Geffrey van der Bos. 
I've been designing and guiding the development of software products for over 10 years. 

On this microblog, I share my thoughts on personal knowledge management, software, and technology.

Nowadays, I'm the software product owner at <a href="https://www.comecer.com/" title="Aseptic Processing and Containment Technologies.">Comecer</a>. A company that provides hardware and software to nuclear medicine facilities.

Before, I was a product owner at <a href="https://www.kaios.ai/" title="AI-solutions for asset management.">Kaios.ai</a>. Where we build AI solutions for the inventorisation of public infrastructure.

I helped build a design team and created award-winning apps as a Product Designer at <a href="https://www.bitfactory.io/">Bitfactory GmbH</a>.
