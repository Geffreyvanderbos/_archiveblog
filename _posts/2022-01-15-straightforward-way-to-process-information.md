title: 'Daily Notes: A way to keep track of information that is crucial to my role'

I overcame the daily information overload I have as Product Manager.

In product management, information comes from everywhere and everyone. So, **I needed a way to conveniently log information as it came in.** I tried paper based notebooks, but that wasn't it. The 10+ apps I gave a shot didn't do it for me either. Eventually, I found the markdown editor [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) a great fit.

I chose Obsidian because it has a built-in [Daily Notes]([https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes]) plugin. It also has an internal linking function that is a surprising addition to the workflow.

Because the editor uses locally saved text files, I can do with them whatever I want. I access the files at any device via cloud storage. I back up the markdown files on my [Backblaze B2 bucket](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html). Even append new lines to today's note with [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for macOS. (More on that in a later post!)

Obsidian works with different 'Vaults' for different uses. And I made one specific to my employer. I filled it up with **notes concerning main actors, industry terms, and things like sensors** and the companies that manufacture them. I've added technical specs, contact details and descriptions on how it all relates to the product.

During my work day, **I jot down bullet-points of what I think is relevant to a generated Daily Note**. I include summaries of results from tests, important reminders, outcomes of meetings, links to new documents, and so on. Where possible, I add a wiki link to build a knowledge network.

And that's the surprising thing about linking the notes. It acts as a powerful, personal wiki. Freeing up space in my biological hard-drive.
