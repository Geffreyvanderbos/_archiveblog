I've designed a minimal, at-home strength training program for myself. I don't have lofty goals or high expectations. It is small enough to do in under 30 minutes for 2-3 times a week.[^1]

I am a novice at strength training. Currently weighing in at 80 kilos, with ≈24% body fat. (Call it a winter reserve.)

My goal is to gain at least 5 kilo of muscle and 20% bodyfat by the end of this year. For reference, you can achieve 3 kilo muscle in 3 months with serious training and diet.

To reach my goals, I need to ingest ≈130 grams of protein per day.[^2] So, I supplement my average, mostly healthy diet with [Huel Black](https://huel.mention-me.com/m/ol/fp2ov-8ff194023f) (also my go-to breakfast), and drink a whey protein shake straight after the workout.[^3]

The equipment I use to workout and track my progress:

- Cast-iron dumbbells (total: 30 kg per db)
- Generic workout bench
- Apple Watch (series 5)
	- [Liftin' Workout App](https://liftinapp.co/)(love this app)
- Apple Airpods Pro (optional)
- [Eufy Smart Scale](https://www.eufylife.com/products/variant/smart-scale/T9140011)
- Apple Health

What I track:

- Volume per week per exercise
- My Fat Free Mass Index ([FFMI](https://www.omnicalculator.com/health/ffmi))
- Estimated protein intake
	- Often referring to [Wikipedia's List of foods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foods_by_protein_content)
- Visual improvement through progress photos

I'll have 2 rice crackers with peanut butter and a banana 30 minutes before a morning workout. I also sip on a pre-workout (creatine and caffeine), but that's optional.

When in gym clothes, I do a quick 5 minute mindfulness session to get in the right mindset. This helps with my mind-muscle connection.[^4] I do not do a generic warmup, nor do I do any stretching. They are often unnecessary.[^5][^6]

I've downloaded my one [workout music album](https://open.spotify.com/album/3j0GCUTDz53x9Mzl8L1Fwz?si=sSopfH2KTyaIxtbFtB6WCA) to my Apple Watch. I leave my phone in another room to keep focus.

My workout plan exists of two days with each a push, leg, pull exercise. I superset (triset) the exercises, and rest for 2 minutes each cycle.[^7][^8] The first set I do with light weights for reminding me of proper technique, and to get the blood flowing.

Per repetition, I keep the muscle 4-8 seconds under tension. To compensate for the lighter weights.[^9] I do as many "good form repetitions" as I can.

This is my current plan:

- Day 1: Arnold Press, Dumbbell Squat, One Arm Dumbbell Row
- Day 2: Dumbbell Press, Dumbbell Deadlift, Dumbbell Pullover

I usually keep 1-3 days of rest in between workouts. My schedule is Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday.

Increasing volume (sets × reps × weight) over time is key to muscle building.[^10] I add more weight to the dumbbell when I consistently exceed 10 repetitions, keeping a rep range of 4-12 in mind.

Every exercise I try to beat my previous repetition by at least 1. Every month, I add a set to the exercises. I've started with 3 sets per exercise.

Proper sleep is essential to muscle synthesis. I am experimenting with behavioral changes to reach 8 hours per night (with 30% deep sleep and 30% REM sleep). A blog post will follow on that experiment.

Eventually it all boils down to motivation. That's why I chose for short sessions with exercises that I enjoy, and tried not to complicate my diet.

*Excuse the random reference styles. I didn't have the will-power to get it all in the same standard.*
