[Amazon dislikes PowerPoint presentations](https://conorneill.com/2012/11/30/amazon-staff-meetings-no-powerpoint/) at meetings.

In his [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beauty-amazons-6-pager-brad-porter/), ex-Amazonian Brad Porter mentions most businesses make decisions based on partial context and logical flaws in data.

Amazon does not. Instead, they use a 6-page narrative memo that everyone reads in the meeting itself. This memo describes:

- The vision of what you're trying to achieve,
- why this will be valuable for your customers
- why this is good for your business
- and the high-level [strategy](../strategy-is-seriously-misunderstood) for achieving the vision.

Writing such a memo requires you to think deeply about an initiative. It forces the writer to consider and address the various perspectives and constraints.

It helps make more informed decisions.
