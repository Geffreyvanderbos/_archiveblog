Executives have their sense of authority and control threatened when they are not kept in the loop. They start doing 'swoop-and-poops': Hasty decisions about things they have little understanding. Ken Blancherd called this (jokingly) _Seagull management_.

The Swoop-and-Poop is a sign that there is a problem with the communication to stakeholders. Look for scalable ways to fix that disconnect.

- Have them occasional join the daily standup
- Transparency in task and roadmaps
- Update emails / calls

Set up a formal process for handling last-minute requests to prevent the poop-and-swoop influencing daily work negatively.
