Teresa Torres' her Continues Discovery means adopting discovery activities in a structured and sustainable way. To enable us to continuously make product decisions with target customer input.

The keyword is _infuse_. Letting your customers lead the development is a mistake. Here is why:

- Every customer has their own preferences. You can't please everyone.
- Your customers might not agree with your vision. They distract.
- Users often don't know what is possible.
- When implementing the solution a user coins, you might miss better, cheaper, and more impactful solutions.

Instead, focus on the problems your target customers experiencing. That is what is meant by 'listening to your customers'.
