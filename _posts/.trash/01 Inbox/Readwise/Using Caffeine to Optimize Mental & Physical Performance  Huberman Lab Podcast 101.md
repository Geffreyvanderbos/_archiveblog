## Highlights
- Caffeine is known to have certain neuroprotectiveeffects.And that is because of its abilityto increase neuromodulators, such as dopamine,but also other so-called catecholamineslike norepinephrine.If you don't know what those names mean,
  these are molecules that increase levels of alertness,motivation, and drive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsgddvjrhmxh1sdjcd496cf))
- But to just give you a sense of howcaffeine works at the level of its timing and impacton mental performance and physical performance, whenwe ingest caffeine, provided that we don't havea lot of food in our stomach and that our blood sugar isn'tparticularly high, generally, we experience an increase
  in alertness within about five minutes.And that increase in focus and alertness peaksaround 30 minutes after ingestion of caffeineand persists for as long as 60 minutes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsgf14vhbs7873q11k98a49))
- But a little bit later, I'll talkabout how you can consume caffeine at regular intervalswhile doing mental work or physical work in a way thatcan further increase mental performanceand physical performance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsgfrfbzdzx93e3z8abjmfy))
- And the answer to that question hasto be pulled from their memory bankswithin their brain, their hippocampus,for instance, a brain structure involved in memory.And if you are asking people, for instance,to remember the capitals of different states or citiesor to remember certain historical facts,they will do that at a particular rate.But if they've ingested caffeine within the hour prior,
  their ability to recall that informationis much, much better. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsghv3r6g94h7ev73wjravz))
- But it also stimulates certain neurotransmittersand so-called neuromodulators within the brain and bodythat give the neural circuits in the brain that
  are associated with learning and memory a lowerthreshold to activation.What does that mean?That means that we are better able to accessthe brain circuitry involved in learning and memorywhen we have a certain amount of caffeine circulatingin our system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsgjgdsn9c82je87dfdsg55))
- And that's because caffeine stimulatesthe release of certain neurochemicals in the brain,in particular, dopamine and acetylcholine,two neuromodulators that increase our focusand alertness and our feelings of well-being. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsgyr5dtdah50qa7azeqkvj))
- Caffeine stimulates the release of dopamine and acetylcholinenot within the classic so-called mesolimbic reward pathway.That's just fancy nerd speak for the rewardpathways of the brain.They're associated with things like sex and foodand drugs of abuse, like cocaine and methamphetamine.But rather, caffeine seems to stimulate
  the release of dopamine in the parts of the brain thatare associated with alertness and cognition,meaning the forebrain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsgzzba25qmsfacnke9ggxs))
- You don't know why, but your nervous systemis a predictive machine, and it has a process in which it backintegrates.Or I should say integrates backwardsinto your immediate experience that preceded that not sogood feeling. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsh5rcfp57ezxkeg7x14wg6))
- Caffeine, as a reinforcer, makes usfeel slightly better or a lot betterin the immediate minutes and hours after we ingest it.So it's acting as a reinforcing agentnot just while you are under the effects of caffeinebut for the things that preceded the ingestion of caffeine,which is why you return again and againto caffeine-containing beverages ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsh87tyfv81pkh0b1n75gt4))
- And last but certainly not least, caffeine
  acts as an adenosine antagonist.It reduces your feelings of lethargy and fatigueand your desire to sleep by parkingin the receptors for adenosine and notallowing adenosine to have its pro-sleepy, if you will,effects on your brain and body. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnshadesgsmkjer1j7vkyhw1))
- but we can reliably say that your body weight isa good measure by which you can estimatewhat a healthy, useful dose of caffeine would be.So for most people, ingesting 1 to 3 milligramsof caffeine per kilogram of body weight
  is going to be the range in which caffeinecan have positive effects without making us feel overlyanxious and give us that feeling that we're jumping outof our skin and turn the otherwisepositive experience of caffeine into an aversive one.

    - Note: One dose means one cup of coffee, not amount of caffeine over the whole day.
- And that is to delay your caffeine intake
  to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up on most days ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnv4b4nk2j2egzeq1qt65fe2))
- delay your caffeine intake
  to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up on most days. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnshz6kwp79fec8wt5vek2mn))
- Tolerance means something very specific.It's the ability to ingest more and more of something
  with a plateau that is a no increase or an actual reductionin the effectiveness of that thing.But here we're not really talking about toleranceto caffeine.What we're talking about is being caffeine-adapted. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnshv1mv8yqeyvt8chv2e2e1))
- By delaying caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking,there are a couple of things that are accomplished.First of all, you offset that afternoon crash ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsj25gcet13wpbcyjmg7qc9))
- And if you didn't sleep that well or deeply enough the nightbefore, you're going to have more adenosine in your system.You might think the logical thingto do is therefore to drink caffeineand to block the adenosine that's there.But what happens if you do that is
  there's an accumulation, a sort of glut of adenosinethat hangs around.And then in the afternoon, when the effects of that caffeinestart to wear off, you will experiencethe so-called afternoon crash. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsj41p2a6bvjsshyc2nzehw))
- you wake up, and you don't ingest caffeine.Fine and, in fact, beneficial to hydratewith water and electrolytes.Terrific.In fact, I would say necessary to getbright light in your eyes ideally from sunlight. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsj9vqwkd24byt1v0xdjz02))
- if you wake upand you ingest caffeine right away,you're blocking the adenosine receptor,but you're not clearing it out.You're also preventing cortisol from having its normal increase
  and rise such that it can directly clear out adenosinebecause cortisol can clear out adenosine.And that's what you want.You want to be at maximum alertnessand focus in your morning and throughout your day.And by delaying your caffeine to 90 to 120 minutes after waking,you set up your system so that you get that morning cortisolpeak.Ideally, a peak that's even greater because you'regetting your bright light viewing.And then when you ingest your caffeine 90 to 120 minutes
  after waking, not only will you be craving it just a littlebit, but you will be drinking that caffeineon an already existing backdrop of increased alertness for tworeasons.One is adenosine is zeroed out, and your cortisol peakis higher. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsjc8qj1z7szc9tjs2p0e55))
- You could simply just have a glass of water alongsideyour coffee or espresso or your yerba mat√© and just put a smallpinch of sea salt in that or evem just playing table salt.And that will help offset some of the jitteriness of caffeine.A lot of people think that, when they ingest caffeine,they get the jitteriness and crash because their bloodsugar is low.
