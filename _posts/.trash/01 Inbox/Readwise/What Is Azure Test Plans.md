## Highlights
- [**Manual and exploratory testing**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/overview?view=azure-devops#manual): Manual and exploratory testing which includes the following test activities:
  • **[Planned manual testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/overview?view=azure-devops#test-plans)**. Manual testing by organizing tests into test plans and test suites by designated testers and test leads.
  • **[User acceptance testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/overview?view=azure-devops#user-acceptance)**. Testing carried out by designated user acceptance testers to verify the value delivered meets customer requirements, while reusing the test artifacts created by engineering teams.
  • **[Exploratory testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/overview?view=azure-devops#exploratory-testing)**. Testing carried out by development teams, including developers, testers, UX teams, product owners and more, by exploring the software systems without using test plans or test suites.
  • **[Stakeholder feedback](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/overview?view=azure-devops#stakeholder-feedback)**. Testing carried out by stakeholders outside the development team, such as users from marketing and sales divisions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp3czx7q41jea0px2vef87nb))
- [**Automated testing**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/overview?view=azure-devops#automated): Azure Test Plans is fully integrated with Azure Pipelines to support testing within continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp3d0vrcp7m3mhwfh820k5f3))
- [**Traceability**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/overview?view=azure-devops#traceability): Test cases and test suites linked to user stories, features, or requirements supports end-to-end traceability ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp3d16hc65ky8t9sre38b95x))
- The work item types—**Test Plans**, **Test Suites**, **Test Cases**, **Shared Steps**, and **Shared Parameters**—support several explicit links to support requirements tracking and sharing test steps and data across many test cases ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp3d4t3vtv23nt8kce4z9s78))
- You create and manage test plans and test suites from the **Test plans** hub. Add one or more test suites—static, requirement-based, or query-based—to the test plans. Export and share test plans and test suites with your teams ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp3d5q450w6beez5ft72ddym))
- You define manual test cases by defining the test steps and optionally the test data to reference. Test suites consist of one or more test cases ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp3d6r4zh7kt6vmjdn95xv0t))
- Within each test case, you specify a set of test steps with their expected outcomes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp3d7b0pmrh8bd6t1yf4n38b))
- User acceptance testing (UAT) helps ensure teams deliver the the value requested by customers. You can create UAT test plans and suites, invite several testers to execute these tests, and monitor test progress and results using lightweight charts. To learn how, see [User acceptance testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/user-acceptance-testing?view=azure-devops).
