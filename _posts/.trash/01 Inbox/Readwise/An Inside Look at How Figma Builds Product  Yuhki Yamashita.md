## Highlights
- The Power of Storytelling as a Leader
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I had a designer friend who moved into a PM roll. I had a product roll at a startup. She's like, Holy shit, I had no idea how hard being a product manager was in a product leader. I get so much more empathy for the PM roll. And so interesting works in both ways. Similarly, I was actually a manager of engineers at one point. And I felt the same way where managing PMs was a lot easier than managing engineers. So yeah, kind of translates to a lot of different roles. Folks listening to your career arc and just all the places you've been, all the wonderful things you've done. Imagine many people are like, wow, how do I have a career like that? Microsoft, Google, Sigma, Uber. If you had to think back and identify maybe one habit or one skill or behavior that you think is most contributed to your success as a leader, as a product leader, what do you think that would be?
  Speaker 1
  People will work with me know that I often talk about storytelling. And in fact, if you've ever reported to me, storytelling has showed up in some kind of performance review, I feel, and that's how much I care about it. And I actually think that a lot of being a great product manager is being great storyteller. And I know a lot of us have already talked about it out there.

- How to be a successful project manager
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And even that's like, that's a lot of power, I think. You know, and what do you take away from all these different Indians that all these leaders had? And like, how do you push that, you know, push the project forward from there? So that's kind of one example. Or another example is, I really love thinking through frameworks and offering ways of talking about a problem where ways of thinking about a problem. And that's kind of synthesis to figuring out all these different disparate parts and kind of, you know, coming up with a way to a lens to look at something. And I feel like it's something that was, I learned mostly through kind of literature classes almost, you know, where you're doing kind of literary commentary and you're reading like, will we have Yates poem? And you're trying to kind of like, you observe all these interesting things. But then you have to take those different observations and like, distill into these things, into something cohesive. And I think that's what a good PM can do, like all these different ideas and opinions and problems and how do you kind of distill it down?

- The Difference Between Microsoft and Google Culture
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Right. And so that was kind of the Microsoft culture back then and your specs had to be perfect, right? Then moved over to YouTube and all of a sudden, you know, you're responsible for an entire app and you have a pretty big team and you cannot specify everything that happens. And so naturally, designers and engineers are just making their own choices, right? Like, maybe there's an air handling situation and, you know, in Microsoft culture, you would have had a table that specifies exactly what happens during that era, right? But in Google culture, it's kind of like, okay, well, then just and just go, designers, we can kind of figure it out. So then it's like, how do they make a really great decision? How do they, you know, we all these local decisions that you're not a part of how do you make sure that the great decisions made? And if everyone is understanding of why we're doing this, what problem we're solving, then, you know, people can make really great decisions. It's the only way you can really scale. So that's kind of where it came from. ([Time 0:20:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/147b3112-6d5e-43ed-b626-480eeb2f83f2))
- Dylan Farrow and the Power of Community
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, I think a lot of it starts with our words and story in many ways, which is that way back when when doing the small group of people or building big money, you know, this is the time when no one believe that was possible to have a design editor in the browser, right? And so it's just same like science fiction almost. And yet what Dylan did, you know, consistently throughout was just put the product in front of designers, ask them for feedback, come back to them the next time with that feedback implemented, and it becomes better and better and better. And you know, at no moment was there kind of this expectation that the desire suddenly turns around and implements that tool in their organization. It was really just about kind of like listening really carefully to what the community had to say. And through that process, making them, you know, evangelists, right? And that's kind of where a lot of how Figma came to be and why we have such a strong connection with our community, where we've actually, you know, they've really helped shape, you know, the product to date.

- The Importance of Having a Sense of What People Are Thinking
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And that's not to say that everything is an implemented verbatim. But, you know, we really find it useful to feel like we have a sense of what people are thinking. And I think like the most crazy version of it maybe is, you know, Dylan's always reading customer feedback and infactress reads the most customer feedback of all of us and has been doing that for like a decade, right? And oftentimes, you know, there used to be this thing where he would drop in tweets that he sees things at different Slack channels to be like, hey, this seems concerning or we're getting this feedback. And it kind of got to a point where, you know, we got big enough where people would feel like they have to drop everything and deal with that tweet. So Chris, R.C. Dylan, I kind of like, intervene. We created this new channel, private channel called Concerning Tweets. And it just, you know, we're this small group of us that Dylan can kind of like drop those in. And these are tweets that aren't going viral by any means. They're just things that he sees with like one, like, sometimes zero likes, but it feels there's an essence of truth to them.

- Balancing Feedback to Ensure Product Success
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  As we've built out our research and data functions, you know, it's really important to kind of balance out the vocal minority with, you know, what's actually happening, right? So I really view some of those tweets more as kind of like canaries in the coal mine in a way. And inputs into many inputs we have around, you know, everything our customers could possibly be experiencing. And, you know, it's important to realize that, you know, we have certain forums like our support tickets where customers are tend to be much more dissatisfied. And we have other kinds of inputs that are kind of sales conversations with prospects, you know, where it's really more about perceptions around fake mind some cases. And I think it's just important, especially as a product manager, to feel like you have this down in the portfolio of different kinds of feedback, to know that you don't have any blind spots.

- How Uber Encourages Its Engineers to Fix Bugs
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  That begs the question of I imagine this engineer at Uber coming back to their desk and like, I'm going to fix this bug. And then their pams like, no, we got a ghost to hit. Here's our priorities. We got this roadmap. We don't have time to fix this right now. It's just one random bug. And so there's kind of two part question, just like you have an approach to that. Do you encourage engineers, designers, just fixed stuff that seems broken slash you mentioned that you have a fun experience with OKRs and how you've approached OKRs at Figma and you've kind of gone back and forth a little bit. And so maybe as a second part, just like talking about your experience with OKRs at Figma.
  Speaker 1
  On the first part, I would say that I think one of the most powerful things, especially for startups, is that kind of bottoms up energy, right? And maybe a developer noticing something is wrong and just going off with fixing it. And for the most part, I try not to get in the way of that because if people are doing that constantly and everyone in the company is kind of trying to make the product better, that is sometimes a way more effective way to improve the quality of experience ([Time 0:38:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/24914dfe-0fe1-43df-b041-72e7dbd8c006))
- The Problem with Publishing OKRs
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so we've done that. And they were definitely better than like, you know, when it first arrived, just because we had a data science team and, you know, we had more rigor around metrics and things like that. But again, like this time it was less about not understanding what people were doing, but more like not understanding if teams are actually committed to moving those OKRs. And one of the problems that you find is, you know, we have these OKRs, but they kind of feel like post-specializations of the projects that you're working on anyway. And at the end of the quarter, you kind of come back and see if those OKRs move fingers crossed, right? But like, if you stop and there's here in the middle of the hallway or the virtual hallway, so to speak, and ask them, okay, like, what are your teams' biggest goals are OKRs? Like, I'm in times like they wouldn't be able to say it. They're just like, well, I'm working on this project that's really important, right? And so it's like, well, what's the point of kind of publishing this OKRs? Like, you're actually not thinking about moving it on a daily basis almost, right?

- Figma's Journey from Product to Data Scientist
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I love hearing that, that whole journey, I feel like you always hear from product teams, here's what we do now. You never hear, here's the experiments we've been through. Here's what we've tried. Here's what worked for a while. Here's what doesn't work now. And here's what we're doing now. So it's really cool just to hear all the experimentation you've done. Clearly, Figma is a company where you encourage experimentation and trying new things that are working. And it's cool they have the flexibility to just like, let's just do headlines for now. No more specific goal metrics. We're just going to build things that we think are important. And then the newsletter posts for folks that are listening, you actually share the templates that you're using these days for planning your projects and kind of laying out your OCRs. So folks can check those out if they're interested in seeing how you're doing that now. You also mentioned you've hired this awesome data scientist.
