## Highlights
- Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t succeed.

- It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnt29h9kyqt973edw67017xj))
- When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnt2b0vfq5vmttq4xy1g1dwh))
- Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnt2ezt2bddw5yhvyb3n8trp))
- The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnt2hn62vacavb8pbayyh4hz))
