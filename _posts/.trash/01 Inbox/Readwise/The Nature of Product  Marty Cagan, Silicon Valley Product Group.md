## Highlights
- The Paradox of the Profit Motive
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, sure. I mean, it's frustrating. And that's kind of what caused me. Occasionally I go through these sort of philosophical waves where I look a little harder about it's frustrating because I really thought by the year 2022, we would not have such a chasm between how good companies work in the rest. There's such strong incentives, like just the profit motive alone. What, why don't more companies want to work like the best? So I find that just perplexing. And yes, it's true when I, and one of the funny things, and I bet you could relate to this, Lenny, I have friends on both sides. You know, I have friends on both sides. The ones that work in not very good companies, a lot of them honestly don't believe me when I describe how good companies work.

- The Old School Way of Doing Product Management
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Why would they do that? Are they crazy? Who would want to work that way? And so this is mind-boggling to me. And anyway, I, when I try to explain to somebody that's never actually worked on a real product team what it's like, you realize that sometimes it feels like I'm speaking a different language to them. And what I realize is that they are so ingrained in this sort of very, very, and I don't even want to say old school because it's not the fact that it's old, it's just the fact that it's obsolete. It's, they have this idea that a product manager does requirements in some form or another, PRDs, user stories, whatever you want. And then a designer's job is to basically make it pretty and maybe do some wire frames. And then the whole mess is taking its sprint planning to the engineers and you say, this is what you need to build next. That is so ingrained, you know, and the road maps, the quarterly road maps come in, it's so ingrained. ([Time 0:05:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d7303ae2-68ed-4a53-b8c1-6972a4930283))
- The Importance of a Good Product Manager
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That is so ingrained, you know, and the road maps, the quarterly road maps come in, it's so ingrained. And they think that the job is, yeah, our job is to crank out features. And a lot of them don't even think twice because that's all they've ever known. And of course I try to explain to them, you know, that's really not how it works in any of your favorite products. Any of your favorite products or companies, it's a very different animal. You know, you've got, you've really got true peers, they're not there to, developers aren't there to just implement your dumb ideas. They are there to help you come up with a great solution. The designer's not just there to make your thing look pretty, they're there to help create a great experience. And by the way, you have a very different job as product manager. You need to bring skills to that team that the team doesn't have in design and engineering. Because together you're able to really do what you need to do.

- The Different Job of a Product Manager
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You know, you've got, you've really got true peers, they're not there to, developers aren't there to just implement your dumb ideas. They are there to help you come up with a great solution. The designer's not just there to make your thing look pretty, they're there to help create a great experience. And by the way, you have a very different job as product manager. You need to bring skills to that team that the team doesn't have in design and engineering. Because together you're able to really do what you need to do. So when I describe that, it's pretty different. These are not minor differences we're talking about. These are pretty dramatic differences. I really do believe at this point in time that feature teams and real product teams should not use the same string product manager. The job is so radically different that it just is misleading to call them both product manager. ([Time 0:06:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/205a5b44-aae1-4c48-b182-c7843429e758))
- Feature Factory or Feature Team?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  For folks listening to this in there like, which one do I work on? I'm not even sure. What are some maybe like three to five signs that you work at a feature factory or feature team as you describe it?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, well, it's not hard to tell for, fortunately, I mean, if you've seen both, it's not hard to tell. In a feature team, basically you are handed a typical roadmap and a roadmap, like almost everybody, even though I wish this wasn't the case, almost everybody have the same thing that it's a prioritized list of features and projects. So some stakeholders got together, usually quarterly, and they say, look, to run our part of the business, we need these features.

- The Difference Between a Feature Team and a Real Product Team
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, well, it's not hard to tell for, fortunately, I mean, if you've seen both, it's not hard to tell. In a feature team, basically you are handed a typical roadmap and a roadmap, like almost everybody, even though I wish this wasn't the case, almost everybody have the same thing that it's a prioritized list of features and projects. So some stakeholders got together, usually quarterly, and they say, look, to run our part of the business, we need these features. It's not really complicated, we need these features. And so they're giving you these features. Now, realize these features are possible solutions. So you're being asked to do a little design and a lot of coding, and then some QA, and then deploy. And more generally, you're there to serve the business. Now compare that to a real product team. In a real product team, first of all, instead of being given a roadmap of prioritized features, they're given problems to solve. So it might be a customer problem, it could be a company problem, it's all fair, but they're problems to solve. And the team is then given the skills so that they can come up with the best solution to that problem. I mean, that's sort of the Netflix principle, is push the decisions down to the people that actually have the knowledge to best solve the problem.

- Netflix's Different Approach to Product Roadmaps
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  In a real product team, first of all, instead of being given a roadmap of prioritized features, they're given problems to solve. So it might be a customer problem, it could be a company problem, it's all fair, but they're problems to solve. And the team is then given the skills so that they can come up with the best solution to that problem. I mean, that's sort of the Netflix principle, is push the decisions down to the people that actually have the knowledge to best solve the problem. That the engineers are working with the enabling technology every single day. The product teams are working with the users and customers every single week. So of course, those are the ones that are closest to those are the ones you wanna push the decision down to. Another difference is when you're given a problem to solve, that's not output, that's outcome. So you either solve it or you don't. As you probably know, most good teams today are doing continuous deployment, continuous delivery. They're releasing many times a day. Who cares if you make another release?

- The Different Roles of a Product Manager in a Feature Team vs. a Product Team
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That's why we say product teams are about outcomes, they're not about output. So feature teams and product teams, they superficially, they're both squads, but they are very, very different. Now, it's worth double clicking on the product manager role because fundamentally, the designer and the engineering role are not hugely different. We're asking the designer and the product and the engineers to step up and care just as much about what you build as how you build, but they're using the skills that you learned in university or wherever. On the other hand, in a feature team, the product manager is basically there to herd the cats to get it now, and that's non-trivial, but they need to get stuff organized, they need to get stuff gathered, these requirements, you need to document them in whatever tool you're using, the gear or something, and then you need to get it to sprint planning, you need to make sure it comes out. That's hurting cats, it's essentially a project management role, but on an empowered ([Time 0:10:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f20b69b5-5985-42db-8305-1d08ad289d70))
- The Product Manager's Role on an Empowered Product Team
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We're asking the designer and the product and the engineers to step up and care just as much about what you build as how you build, but they're using the skills that you learned in university or wherever. On the other hand, in a feature team, the product manager is basically there to herd the cats to get it now, and that's non-trivial, but they need to get stuff organized, they need to get stuff gathered, these requirements, you need to document them in whatever tool you're using, the gear or something, and then you need to get it to sprint planning, you need to make sure it comes out. That's hurting cats, it's essentially a project management role, but on an empowered product team where you're trying to come up with a solution that solves the problem you've been assigned, that's much harder because that means we have to discover a solution that's valuable, usable, feasible, viable. Now, while the engineer is definitely own feasible and the designer definitely owns usable, valuable and viable, the engineer too, the hardest things to do, that's the product manager.

- The Heuristic: How to Choose the Best Practices
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Oh, I mean, it's funny. So first of all, and I should always say this at the very beginning, whenever I work with teams, I always try to remember to say this somewhere, nothing I talk about, and I honestly being very clear, nothing I've written about and inspired, nothing I've written about and powered was invented by us. All we do is share the practices we see being used in the best teams. So the heuristic is pretty easy. If it's used by several of the best teams, we're like, okay, let's start recommending it, let's see how it works there, and if it works well, we'll start advocating it. And on the other hand, somebody says, oh, have you heard about this process, or have you heard about this tool? And if none of those companies are using it, I'm like, don't bother me. It's either it's either snake oil, or it's not proven yet. We don't invent any of this stuff, we just try to share it. ([Time 0:12:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/35e5dac3-783b-43e2-93b9-9e82795eb6cd))
- How to Untangle Your Company's Culture from the Technique
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's either it's either snake oil, or it's not proven yet. We don't invent any of this stuff, we just try to share it. There's a little bit, I mean, I don't wanna, I'd say that the thing that we do is we try to untangle the company's culture from the technique, because every club, you know, Amazon's got their favorite cultural stuff. Google does, Netflix does, Stripe does, and don't get me wrong, I love those cultures, but they're all different cultures. They're very different cultures. So what we're trying to do is untangle that and share the techniques themselves. But you can read books, like working backwards from Amazon describes what I talk about all the time, but it's using Amazon terms. You can read no rules rules from Netflix. You can see how that's done. You can read build that talks about how Apple did it. You know, it's just, it's all great, but you've gotta work a little harder to see the common threads. That's really what we're trying to do. ([Time 0:12:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3f1a13b9-5646-4b9d-becc-5ec9a958086d))
- The Declining Fraction of Companies that Succeed
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That's really what we're trying to do. But all these companies, Stripe, fabulous Shopify, you know, look at what Slack has done, even props to Spotify, they've been able to hold their own against Apple and Amazon for so many years. I mean, and of course I'm talking about well-known brands, there's countless small companies that nobody's heard of, but most hopefully if they keep doing well, you know, people will hear of them one day, but no, it's not a few companies. And there's great companies all over the world today. But it is true that it's a small fraction of total companies. And that's the part that really bothers me.
  Speaker 2
  Do you ever sense what that fraction is? We're presented you.
  Speaker 1
  You know, I had this conversation actually, you know, Shriosh Dosh, too, don't you? He's one of my favorite thinkers. Yeah, he's one of my favorite thinkers in product. He's just terrific. Cause he's also one of those people, at first he was asking me, do people really work like you right about, you know, really they're that clueless?

- The Lost Interview: Steve Jobs Before He Returned to Run Apple
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  For a long time, and I don't know if this is still accurate, but for a long time, the industry analysts that I read said that it was actually much bigger number of people doing custom solutions around the world. And so none of those people would really count. So it's hard to say, I don't even know how, does anybody know how many companies really do commercial products? And then what percentage? My purely anecdotal guess is maybe 10 to 15% are good product companies, something like that.
  Speaker 2
  Sweet, I love that there's a number. All right.
  Speaker 1
  Who knows? Who knows? It could be orders of magnitude off. Seems, seems reasonable.
  Speaker 2
  So lens that I want to use for part of the rest of our chat is this documentary that you've been recommending in some of your writing that I recently watched, and I'm really excited to chat about it. It's a documentary called The Lost Interview, where the interview Steve Jobs, after he was fired from Apple, but before he came back to run Apple.

- The Difference Between the Best and the Rest
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. Well, one of the reasons I loved it is he very rarely talked about product. He loved to talk about his products. He loved to talk about why the iPhone was awesome, why the iPod was awesome, why the Mac was awesome. But the nature of building products was not. I mean, that was sort of his secret sauce, if you will, is he had a very good on insights to this. And so to find this hour plus interview where he's very thoughtful, very sort of, he had had a chance to kind of think through what went well, what went wrong. And to answer your question, in my own writing, and in fact, in the recent book Empowered, I share my theory for why there's such a big difference between the best and the rest. In other words, why isn't every company trying to work like the best companies? I mean, why not? Look at the valuation they get. For money alone, you'd think it would do that. And my best sort of theory was that, well, the biggest reason I see is that they have never worked at a company like that, so they don't know what it looks like. They don't know what good looks like. ([Time 0:16:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b65d0fa9-fb73-4db3-bc3e-9a878c319b86))
- The Importance of Product
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But the one that struck me the most was his theory for why there are so many bad product companies. And his theory was, and I, by the way, I don't want, I hope everybody that's listening to your podcast it costs $4 to rent this on Amazon Prime. Definitely you should watch it the whole thing. So don't let my summary discourage you. It's worth watching. But anyway, he shares that he thinks what happens in general is companies get bigger. You know, obviously they wouldn't have got big if they didn't have a decent product at one point or another. But what he was talking about is the same thing I am. Why is it that so many companies lose that mojo? And his argument was, because as a company gets bigger, product historically became less important. The people in a company that would be celebrated were marketing people, sales people, finance people. ([Time 0:18:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9a038cd7-702f-472a-ba89-656885a527ec))
- The Cost of Not Innovating
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You know, obviously they wouldn't have got big if they didn't have a decent product at one point or another. But what he was talking about is the same thing I am. Why is it that so many companies lose that mojo? And his argument was, because as a company gets bigger, product historically became less important. The people in a company that would be celebrated were marketing people, sales people, finance people. These are people that, because if a company stops innovating, these are the engines for growth, right? Sales marketing were not growth with finance, but cutting costs. And his argument was, this happens over time, pretty soon, these are your leaders. They're the ones that have been promoted. So then what happens? Good product people don't want to work there anymore. And they leave. And they go to a company that values product. ([Time 0:19:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/53efb701-f0e9-44d0-9988-9f2161753de0))
- The Anti-Pattern of Keeping the Disease of Success Alive
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I like that he describes these as diseases of a company. They own like enough market share. This is what happens. There's just growth is happening. They're winning. They don't need to keep innovating. And it becomes this disease. And it's a really powerful way of thinking about it, that you want to try to keep this disease from taking over your culture and product and company. And I think there's like market share, and then just generally it happens to companies just doing well. Things are going well. We'll just keep that. It's not break anything. Why launch something risky and new? And why not just keep selling this thing that everyone seems to want?
  Speaker 1
  And actually, Lenny, I think it's worth highlighting because that is an anti-pattern I see a lot, especially after the founders leave. You know how a lot of times in product we'll talk about there's value creation activities, there's value capture activities. Discovery is all about value creation, optimization is all about value capture. And they're both great. Absolutely, you should do both. ([Time 0:20:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0130b91e-c387-449c-91db-f83e7bd9085f))
- The Importance of Product Discovery
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And then in fact, that was one of the diseases that Steve Jobs highlighted in that interview. He called it the disease of the stakeholders, of the managers where they think that an idea is 90% of the work. And that's how he called it out. And he's like, you don't understand. The idea is minor. The idea is just to start. I think he said, you know, it is like the whole craftsmanship of going from an idea to a product. This is what we call product discovery. He was describing product discovery and how things change constantly with every iteration you make trade-offs. It starts off one way, it ends up another way. And of course, he's pointing out that most of these executives have no idea, no appreciation for that's actually how you get a great product. It's not that a bunch of executives go in a room and they come up with their prioritized list of features and then they just tell the teams to build them.

- The Danger of Focusing on the Solution
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  As touch as on a question, I definitely wanted to ask, which is sometimes founders or leaders think they're like, I just know what to build. Why do we need to go through this whole thing? Just like, just build this thing. I'm very confident this is the answer. And what you talked about just now is a big reason for that, right? Is a lot of times you don't and you think you do. And a lot of the magic happens in that process of building and iterating, learning, talking to customers. Is that as easy as you?
  Speaker 1
  Absolutely. And there is one sort of danger zone that a lot of product teams inadvertently fall into there, which is, you know, when we talk about discovery, technically there's two kinds of discovery, right? There's discovering the problem to solve that you should focus on and discovering the solution that you're gonna deliver that people would buy. And a lot of product teams, ([Time 0:24:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3f5dc4a5-76b4-4f21-b3df-9f87b57a419d))
- The Problem with Validation
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The founder knows the problem. In fact, most of the company knows the problem. But a lot of times a product team thinks that they're supposed to, even if, you know, they're confident on the problem that they're supposed to go through these some number of weeks or months of problem validation, you know, making sure that people really have that problem. Enough of them have that problem. They understand that problem. And, you know, they're, again, in an ideal world with no constraints, not really a problem. But in the real world, the clock is ticking. And if you use, say, two weeks up, just verifying the same thing the founder already knew, that founder is probably very frustrated at this point because you haven't even got to work on the solution. And people don't buy the problem, they buy your solution. Obviously, they don't buy it if it's not solving something they care about. ([Time 0:25:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/00bd942b-a77f-4d0b-9a83-e81084acef4e))
- The Importance of Solution Discovery in Product Management
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But there are many products that are solving what they care about. The real question is, do you solve it better than everybody else so that they buy you? And that's where you need to take time. So this is more like the coaching I give the teams. I tell them, look, be careful. If you need to spend a little time on the problem, fine, but don't spend a lot of time because you need to save as much time as possible to come up with the winning solution. And it's worth pointing out, since we were talking about Steve Jobs, he was all about the, that was solution discovery when he was describing the sort of 5,000 things you'd keep in your head, that's the solution discovery. So that's important. Product teams need to know that that's where they will either succeed or fail.

  I know that, I know this point is really important to you, this idea that PMs are taught that their job is to figure out the what and not the how. ([Time 0:26:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4aca6f93-911e-4918-a539-9f007a448268))

  I know that, I know this point is really important to you, this idea that PMs are taught that their job is to figure out the what and not the how. And just to reinforce this point, you're a big fan of no, that's completely wrong. PMs are very responsible for the how also.
  Speaker 1
  That one always makes me laugh because I was thinking, do you know how many hours a week I need to work if that was my only job? Just to spend, you know, I'd probably I'd phone it in 15 minutes a week. I'm done, I did my part. This is ridiculous. And of course it misses, again, all you have to do is think through it a little deeper. When you're trying to come up with a successful solution, I mean, there are different taxonomies out there. The one I use is, it's gotta be valuable, usable, feasible, viable. But most products fit, those are the risks. ([Time 0:27:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/81945982-129d-40b5-981b-282e904cc281))

  I just don't know where the origin is for all that stuff. Makes me think about, man always joke that they're like, I wanna wear something more interesting to events. Like I always wear a suit, and it's always gotta be a suit, so boring. And other folks are like, shut up. It's so like, why would you wanna complicate the life of men and having to address more creatively? Like we got a good thing going with suits. And it makes me think about if the jobs of a PM are just to find the problems like, all right, let's go with that, life's good. And turns out it's not, yeah. Anyway, your last point also made me think about this. Recent tweet by, I think it's Patrick Holison or John Colison about how a lot of people think user research. It's kinda like user research informs exactly what you, or informs what you built. That's how people think about it. It's like user research leads to what you built.

  Yeah, I mean, first of all, what they've done with Stripe is so awesome. And that's another great example. And I love what they sort of picked and choose from great companies to create a culture for themselves. So I'd absolutely agree, but I'd go a little further because user research is a great topic. I mean, right there, it's a great product topic. I love it. I'm a big fanboy user research. Well, you just heard me basically arguing the same thing. Don't be going out there, spending all your time just validating the problem, especially when we know. He's saying that too.

  Yeah, I mean, first of all, what they've done with Stripe is so awesome. And that's another great example. And I love what they sort of picked and choose from great companies to create a culture for themselves. So I'd absolutely agree, but I'd go a little further because user research is a great topic. I mean, right there, it's a great product topic. I love it. I'm a big fanboy user research. Well, you just heard me basically arguing the same thing. Don't be going out there, spending all your time just validating the problem, especially when we know. He's saying that too. He's trying to talk about building the mental model of our users, which is so important. This is well-designed products or feed off of that. However, there's another layer around user research that I find is even a bigger source of confusion. In fact, I was just talking to a team this morning that was saying that, yeah, what they do with user research is they test their prototypes. And when they get enough of users saying how much they like it, they build it. I'm like, no, that's not why we do user research. And that is not gonna fool any smart leaders.

  However, there's another layer around user research that I find is even a bigger source of confusion. In fact, I was just talking to a team this morning that was saying that, yeah, what they do with user research is they test their prototypes. And when they get enough of users saying how much they like it, they build it. I'm like, no, that's not why we do user research. And that is not gonna fool any smart leaders. The main reason, now again, we're kind of back to the problem discovery, solution discovery, but when most of our time needs to be on solution and that's prototyping, that's testing with users, testing with customers, testing with stakeholders, testing with our developers, we're testing constantly. We are not just trying to find out if they like it. In fact, it's just the opposite. It's when we're doing user research, we're finding all the reasons they don't like it.

- The Difference Between Generative and Evaluative User Research

  Even though Elon Musk has some issues right now, he's pretty good at product. And so he is very good at this. And that's how you wanna think about that. This is often the user researchers will talk about the difference between generative and evaluative user research. And so most of it in terms of number of, valuable things we get out of it is evaluative. They are telling us the reasons they won't use it. The only other thing I'll add to that, you didn't ask about this, but it comes up all the time. I hate it when the user researchers go off and do the research themselves and bring back to report. Not because they don't know what they're doing, they do know what they're doing. The reason is because the report is too often ignored. And so to me, the rule is, and I tell this to user researchers at the companies that I coach, if the product manager and the designer are not available to be there during your product, their products test, cancel the test. They need to be there. This is what makes them useful to their team. ([Time 0:32:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/80577d0e-ef3e-4790-a31b-de1e775cea16))
