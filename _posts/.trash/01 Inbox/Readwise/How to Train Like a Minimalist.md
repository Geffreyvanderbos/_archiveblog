## Highlights
- I wrotehim a very minimalistic program thatonly takes him 20 minutes once a this is
  the exact program he does one pushexercise one Pull exercise and one legexercise once a week ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp2va8ynrja0ngxgxhxpp8db))
- one heavy set done one tothree times per week will be enough toinduce significant strength gains ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp2vbz190sbh2qr0106r575a))
- sofor strength you can get away with doingvery little total lifting as long aswhen you do lift it's reasonably heavyideally coming in the one to five repZone ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp2vdz8a56xh46rjxzmqmcyb))
- you can see maximum healthbenefits with just a half hour to anhour of lifting per week ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp4emzs9b2vtgp792veh782k))
- there's a much clearer positiverelationship between training volume andmuscle hypertrophy training ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp4enthhhyw47cgspxm2sj2m))
- ifyou did 10 plus sets per week this isyour maximum possible gains doing justone to four sets per muscle per weekjust one to four sets will get you notten percent of the gains not twentypercent of the gains but 64 percent of
  Maximum gains ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp4eta720hy47qdt9cmd7qq6))
- if you do decide to do alittle more let's say five to nine setsper week that would bring you up to 84of Maximum gains ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp4evda6ptzg9v8ks3d3cmvq))
- on average people will make 64percent of Maximum gains by doing one tofour sets per week but that doesn't meanthat everyone will make exactly 64 ofMaximum gains ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp4ey9m7j9y9cv6v19nfv7hs))
- Martin Birkin whoinspired a generation of minimalistswith his famous around itis articleexplaining how so many people wastetheir time in the gym by not trackingworkouts ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp4f1ezeme94w9txvba9nher))
- first minimaliststrategy is to push yourself harder thanusual ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp4f38eh8cr0eppzre8zx3hc))
- mymost important tip on a minimalistroutine most sets should be taken allthe way to failure so an rpe of 10 or at
  least within a rep or so of failure soan RP of nine ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp4f49byesmzdhs7ptqmnccr))
- DrBrad schoenfeld suggests that drop setscan be used to increase training volumewithout substantially increasing sessionduration to make workouts more efficientnow ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp4f4z43vk4w0dbsqjyjqyx5))
- third minimaliststrategy is to use so-called sensiblesupersets ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp4f6sqa1n728vdmas582cpv))
- researchshows that shorter rest periods tend tobe worse for hypertrophy because youcan't fully recover in between sets so
  resting one to four minutes between setsis the typical science-basedrecommendation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp4fax7cjykr2m5rk7mgwhg7))
- you canstill maximize hypertrophy because yourcardiovascular endurance will improveallowing you to recover faster inbetween sets in other words you canstart by resting say two minutes betweensets in week one then rest for 15seconds Less in week two 15 seconds lessagain in week three until eventually youget down to just one minute rest inbetween sets ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp4fck612qjw0tq889b9f8mz))
