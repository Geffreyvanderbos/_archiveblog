## Highlights
- - The best way to manage time is not to thinkof it as time management at all, but priority management.After all, it's not just a matter of rearranging timesometimes there just isn't enough.I work full-time as a developer advocatepart-time as a content creator, have my hobbies.For startersI played 134 tabletop role playing game sessions last year.Each one lasting on average about three hours.I read 50 books.I traveled to eight different countries
  some of them multiple times.Oh, and I bought an apartment and movedto a new country and started learning that language.So like most people, I've got a lot going on, in this video.I'm gonna show you how I've got things setup so that I can keep trackof everything that I'm doing and want to be doingnot so you can copy exactly what I'm doingbut just so you can get some ideasfor things that maybe will work for you as well.In general, I like to categorize my setup
  into the things that are for the futurefor the present and for the past.And I start with the future firstbecause that's the essence of planning.Like you're looking ahead and trying to set intentions.So for me, that consistsof goals, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly goals.In addition to my core principlesbut actually start with the core principles.So in core principles, I define as a one-offalthough it's still a living document
  all the principles that really matter most to me.And for each principleI describe what it is and what it lookslike when I'm practicing it and not practicing it.I have less than 10 of these.These are things that I've identified over timeand I'm still like merging some and adding new ones as I go.In software testing, we have something called a requirementand that usually comes from the business and it's the ideaof what it is that we're supposed to build.It's the specifications for the code that we want todeliver, but the requirements come at different levels.
  You might have one overarching kind of requirementthat says, you know, build this site, butunderneath that site there might be, you know, the homepage.And under the homepage it might be, you knowget the graphic design underway.So there are different levels of requirementsbut there's also a best practice called requirementstraceability, and that is the practice of making surethat lower level requirements all trace upto the highest one.That's just a tech way of saying that when you work
  on something, you need to be making sure that it is stillin line with your overall direction.And that's kind of what I like to do here.So with the core principles, I embed thatinto the yearly template.I'm gonna show you all of this in a second.And then the yearly into the quarterly.Quarterly into monthly.Monthly into weekly, and then weekly into the daily note.So let me show you how that works in practice.I'm gonna be showing you this on my Patreon vault.
  So all of the templates are therebut they're gonna be blank.So first, let's start with a yearly review.It's kind of a propos because it's January right now.So this is the yearly reviewand you'll see that I used the periodic notes pluginand I have some sections here.Now I just put a whole bunch of OKRs.OKRs stands for objectives key result.It's just a framework that we use at workso I find it handy to use it as well.And it just means that when you set an objectiveyou have to make sure to attach key results to it.
  So I've got my fake objectives hereand this is actually pulling in the objectives from 2022.Now if I scroll down here, then I have, you know, objectivesfor this year, and then I just have a template herefor adding the yearly OKR.So then I'd select thatand then I'd say something like 2023 objective here.And what that does is it creates a page
  and then opens up that page according to a certain template.So then we would have the key result here.And here I would linkto some of the core values or core principles.So I had my core principlesand then maybe I'll say principle oneof course this would actually be the name.And then initiative would be here after the yearI would do the quarterly note.And that one has a linkto my core principles and also the yearly objectives.
  I didn't have a quarterly reviewin this dummy one last quarterbut it would be here, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp49vfdq3j9aks6vrh72vav3))
