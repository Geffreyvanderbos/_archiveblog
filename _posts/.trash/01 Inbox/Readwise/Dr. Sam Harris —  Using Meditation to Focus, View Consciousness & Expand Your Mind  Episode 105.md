## Highlights
- The Illusoryness of the Self
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yourself as distinct. Your self as the whole person and, you know, as psychological continuity with your past experience as being distinct from the person and psychological continuity of some other person, right? Obviously, we have to be able to conserve those data. ([Time 0:12:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/db5788ea-9384-458d-b965-714b15cc88f1))
- Is There a Soul?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Most people are what my friend Paul Bloom calls common sense dualists. You're used to the default expectation seems to be that whatever the relationship between the mind and the body, there's this, there's some promise of separability there. ([Time 0:14:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d4389027-eee8-4659-a17f-3081b3951095))
- The Ultimate Purpose of Meditation
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So you're going to lower your stress and you're going to increase your focus and you're going to, you know, stave off cortical thinning and all kinds of good things that science is saying meditation will give you. And none of that entails really drilling down on this paradoxical claim that the self is an illusion or anything else of that sort. ([Time 0:16:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4a98e6dd-93fb-4616-8e1f-78a9281a6520))
- I'd Still Be Andrew
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Whereas if we were to lesion a couple square millimeters out of my parietal cortex, it's an open question as to whether or not I would still seem as much like Andrew to other people into myself. And so there's something fundamentally different about the real estate in the cranial vault, right? We don't remove both of my eyes. I'd still be Andrew. ([Time 0:20:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3414bae0-9a26-4b52-b12d-c0e9bf760ec8))
- How Memory Works: A Micro-Stroke's Effect on Procedural Memory
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's no place in your memory where you can inspect by just sitting in your chair that you've retained the knowledge of how to ride a bike. Like it's procedural memory is different from semantic or episodic memory. If I ask you, do you know your address? Yes, you can recall your address just sitting there. But if you had had a micro stroke that neatly dissected out your ([Time 0:24:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/17e905aa-75d5-4b88-bb54-156d103f6288))
- The Qualitative Character of the World
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The fact that the world and our internal experience is illuminated, that it has a qualitative character. And then there's a question of what is that qualitative character? What is it, you know, what kinds of information do we have access to? What does it feel like to be us? How do, how do different states of arousal change that? So you talked about fear? Yeah, I mean, fear can change a lot of things. ([Time 0:25:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6995733f-47ec-487d-be63-bf154f1af4f6))
- Meditation: Changing Contents of Consciousness or Encouraging Pro-Social Emotions?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And to come back to meditation for a second, many people think meditation is about changing the contents of consciousness. You, there's some contents you want to get rid of, like anxiety, other contents you want to encourage, like calm and, you know, unconditional love, or, you know, some other, you know, classically pleasant, pro-social emotion. And that's all fine, that's all possible. ([Time 0:26:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/17ca0bd9-643c-4817-a5c0-2925307b461d))
- The Wisdom of Meditation
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And that's all fine, that's all possible. But the real wisdom of, you know, the 2000 year old wisdom of meditation that really is the, you know, the chewy center of the tosy pop is a recognition of what consciousness itself is always already like, regardless of the contents and the changes in contents. ([Time 0:26:58](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c2bac260-2083-4f6a-b0fa-ee802299ca70))
- Are You Losing Yourself in Your Work?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yes, it's very fast. Now, there's an analogous suppression, I would say, of the sense of self that occurs every time attention gets absorbed significantly in its object, right? So like, we even have this concept of losing yourself in your ([Time 0:31:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cb6b7b51-33a1-4761-ac72-8e97144bf523))
- The Flow of Unity
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  For that moment, you were no longer looking over your own shoulder or anticipating the next moment or trying to get somewhere where you weren't or, you know, micromanaging errors or like this, you know, there's not, there's just the flow of unity with whatever the, you know, whatever the experience is, you know, a surface.

- Is There Any Neurologic Syndrome?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And like your mind is just continually narrating a conversation you're having with yourself, however paradoxically. I mean, you're telling yourself things that you already know as though there were two of you rather often, right? Like, you know, you're just, you know, I'm looking for, you know, which is the water. And so there it is, right? ([Time 0:32:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/61414513-348b-44e4-8e5e-25e5bea36f46))

- Meditation: The Anchor to Reality
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I mean, like once you have the requisite conceptual, you know, anchor to it, then every time you look, you're going to find it again and eventually becomes effortless. And that's what ultimately meditation is. I mean, this kind of meditation, you ultimately learn to recognize that there's no separation from you between you and your experience, right? There's not the experience on the one hand and the self on the other. ([Time 0:54:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8ff58af4-a28d-44bb-8441-e8a4bb4ee980))
- The Dualistic Mind and the Benefits of Meditation
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Meditation is the act of doing that more and more dispassionately so you're no longer grabbing at the pleasant or pushing the unpleasant away. You're just kind of relaxing and in the most non judgmental frame of mind, just witnessing the flow, right? But if you're doing that dualistically, you feel like the meditator, you feel like the subject, aiming attention. ([Time 0:55:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d7494b19-bc1a-49a8-9e56-8dc730e0a2de))
- Meditation - What Is It?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The mechanics of attention whereby you are denying yourself that unity of experience so much of the time and recognizing that it's based on a misperception of the way consciousness always already is. ([Time 0:57:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9e696d01-1206-4393-8e33-9c6326799ad5))
- We're Not Set Up by Evolution to Be as Happy as We Can Be
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  They just kind of came along for the ride. What Stephen Jay Gould called a spandrel. So we are not set up by evolution to be as happy as we possibly can be, and to do almost anything that interests us well. ([Time 1:04:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fbbd9f92-c65f-497a-a24c-3dbf570128c4))
- The Benefits of Flexibility
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The reason why we have, you know, we have this time of immaturity, and that becomes, has become functional for us is that it's just we're far more flexible, and we can learn based on the needs of an environment to do, you know, so much more than a gazelle ([Time 1:08:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7ac4e6da-ede8-49b6-a72a-d8fd62c69bc1))
- The Moral Hardware and Software of Toddlers
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We recognize others first, and we're in certainly in relationship immediately, and we orient to human faces, and we even detect other humans as good and bad moral actors very early. I mean, certainly long before we recognize ourselves in a mirror. We, the experiments run again, this is Paul Bloom and colleagues experiments run on kind of the moral hardware and software of developing toddlers.

- The Magical Narcissism of a Newborn
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And all of that attention, you have all of these people coming up, you know, to the crib and making faces at you cheering. Yeah, and it's all pointed at you, right. So there's a, you know, there's a classic magical narcissism that gets constructed there. If you take the psychological literature, or, you know, at least a certain strand of it, seriously. ([Time 1:11:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d29ae931-afce-41e4-af0e-f70b9b3560e4))
- The Language Is So Useful, Right?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And what happens to us strangely, and this comes back to the logic of evolution, we never stop, because evolution never thought to build us an off switch for this, right? I mean, the language is so useful, and it gets tuned up so strongly for us. ([Time 1:15:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1f161e3d-8226-47bc-8659-246aa8881369))
- The Interrupting Voice in Our Heads
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So like you and I are talking now, and you know, people are listening to us, they're struggling to follow the train of this conversation because it is competing with the conversation that's happening in their heads, right? So they'll be saying something, and a person listening will say, well, what does that mean? Or like, oh boy, I mean, he just contradicted himself, or like, and there's a voice in your head that is also vying for your attention, much of the time. ([Time 1:16:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5ca170d8-76c6-4317-8c87-0833274d721a))

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And yet some percentage of them are so distracted by thought that they would think that they will actually try this experiment and think they succeeded, right? And for these people, what happens is you put them on a meditation retreat and you have them spend 12 hours a day in silence doing nothing but this, right? ([Time 1:23:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/030b8ac3-a331-4c1d-996b-a76858527f80))
- How to Overcome Distraction
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Because what they're discovering is just how distractable they are, right? And, you know, for some people, that will be immediately obvious. For some people, it'll actually take a lot of practice to realize just how distracted they are.
  Speaker 2
  What you just said, which was that at some point, we can start noticing our thoughts. ([Time 1:25:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5362bcd6-dc58-4cda-82cd-2a38edde2ecc))

- The Physiology of Cortisol Release
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  How do I get rid of this? You know, why am I this sort of person? You know, should I have taken a beta blocker? You know, this is the conversation you're having with yourself. The moment you just become willing to feel it as the pure energy of, you know, the physiology of, you know, cortisol release, it ceases to have any meaning. ([Time 1:33:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5096251d-2d9f-4078-b9ed-6fc2c520b878))
- Mindfulness Training
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But this whole dance of lost in thought. Now, I'm strategically directing my attention again. All of this seems to ramify this sense of self, the sense of there's one to be doing this. There's somebody holding the spotlight of attention and getting better at coming back to the object of meditation. ([Time 1:35:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/428fda54-961e-4f85-8cf2-6dc0d6c20fe0))
- The Confabulatory Brain
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And if I ask you to just say one, right, so just. Minneapolis is what came to mind. For me, it was very straightforward. It was Minneapolis, the famous person was Joe Stromer, and they just, like, I can give you reasons why I think those came to mind. Recent conversations. Okay. So, so, so whatever.
  Speaker 1
  So we know, we know a fair bit about, a fair bit about much of this. So one, we know that your reasons, you know, obviously could be right or wrong. They're very likely to be wrong because we have this sort of confabulatory storytelling mechanism, even in an intact brain where we just. You know, we, we all seem to never lack for the reasons why something came to mind. And we know, we can know, we can manipulate people in ways that prove that people are just reliably wrong and confident, you know, confidently so about the reasons why they thought of things or did things. ([Time 1:40:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3f27d258-1e72-4e9a-87ab-a0039c5ac57f))
- The Illusion of Free Will
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Just get all the synapses and the synaptic weights and, you know, everything in the state, it was in to produce Joe Strummer in Minneapolis, right. You're going to rewind that movie that, you know, that part of the movie of your life, you're going to say Joe Strummer in Minneapolis a trillion times in a row, right. So this is why, in my view, the notion of free will makes absolutely no sense, right. And you can add as much randomness to that process as you want. It still doesn't get to the freedom people think they have. There's another conversation to have about, you know, why none of that matters and why things only get better once you admit to yourself that free will is an illusion. And yes, you can get in shape and you can die it. You can do all the things you want to do and you don't have to think about free will. But the, from a, from a contemplative meditative point of view, the thing to notice is that everything is just springing into view, right. You're like, there's no place from which you are authoring your next thought because you would have to think it before you think it, right. Like, like, there is just, there is just this fundamental mystery at our backs that is discouraging everything that we experience. What if I'm speaking? ([Time 1:42:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bd1b6601-fa9e-4beb-b13c-726a31ab6ba6))
- The Mystery of Choice
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You know you like you like coffee and you like tea and you're deciding which to have right both are on offer you got two cups in front of you and, and the question is you know which you know or here I've got water and I've got coffee which am I going to drink next. So it's incredibly is the simplest possible decision. And no matter how long I make this decision process I could literally sit for an hour trying to figure out which to reach for next. And I could have my reasons why and I could have my all myself talk. There's there's going to be a final change in me that's going to be the proximate cause of me deciding one over the other. And that no matter how laborious I can make it seem in terms of my reasoning about it. It is going to be fundamentally mysterious as to why I went with one rather than the other ([Time 1:45:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9a9215de-57ad-4e61-96ab-6c5617be13f7))
- The Illusion of Control
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And it inspires me to go further down this path of meditation because I've never experienced that, not deliberately and certainly not through meditation. If I ever experienced it, it was transient enough that I, you know, I'm intrigued to experiencing more. So on the one hand, you're telling me something was never there and there's a profound experience to be had by anyone that's willing to do the work to arrive at that experience of the loss of that illusion. On the other hand, I'm hearing that there's a profound gap that really does exist, which is that we, we believe that our thoughts are somehow from us and indeed they're from in the cranial vault someplace, maybe in the body a bit as well, but that we over attribute the degree to which we are that and that is us in a way that's volitional, that we control. And so once I'm hearing that there's something, there's an illusion that we can eliminate. And on the other hand, I'm hearing that there's an illusion that we can't eliminate. ([Time 1:53:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9f5d4042-774e-4e2a-9b8a-862a664aa68f))
- The Search for the Missing Tourist
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Um, so everyone gets concerned as this, this, the, the, the tourist doesn't, you know, show up and they start looking for her, right? And they can't find her. And so a search party is formed and the Asian woman because of the, whatever language barrier, um, thought it heard that there was a missing tourist. So she joins the search party, which in fact is looking for her, right? And this goes on into the night and they're readying helicopters at, you know, for a dawn patrol to find the mission missing tourist. Um, now at some point along the way, I think it was at like three in the morning, this tourist realizes that she is the object of this search, right? And obviously the whole thing unravels. She, you know, she confesses that she changed her clothes and, you know, the problem is solved, but the problem is not solved by the, the logic that the seeker is expected. Right? So it's like, it's not true to say that the missing tourist was found in, in the way that was expected, right? Cause the missing tourist was never lost. ([Time 1:58:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/30495843-9780-42c3-b42a-66b992e7ff56))
- The Search for the Missing Person
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is what the, the confused tourist feels like in her own search party and she's, she's looking, she's looking for the missing person. And so the, the angle of, of, you know, the inclination of all of this is, and the logic of it is all wrong, you know, understandably so, given how we, we all get into this situation. But you know, it's useful to continually try to under, undercut it and recognize that the thing that's being looked for is, is actually right on the surface, which is either the, there is no one looking, there is no place from which you are paying, if you're paying attention to the breath or to sounds or noticing the next thought arise, this sense that you are over here doing that thing is actually what it's like to be thinking and not knowing that you're thinking. You're not, there's a, there's a thought, there's an undercurrent of thought that's going to be unexpected in that moment. ([Time 2:02:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c0590e3e-61bc-4364-98c2-2226c59a04cd))
- The Open Hand of Meditation
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  It's a failure to describe the physical relationships between anything in the world. Yeah, that's just not the world we live in, right?
  Speaker 1
  So, but it's a funny thing. It's, it, but, but on some level, that is true of meditation. It's like you can't get there from here. Like, but the sense of you, the sense of you as subject isn't brought along to this thing you're looking for, right? Like you're like, you're, you know, it's almost like, it's almost like you're, you're making a fist and you're trying to get to an open hand. The fist doesn't get to take that journey as a fist, right? Like you don't, the fist doesn't go along for the ride. ([Time 2:05:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f7a373c9-a44d-4c2f-a74a-f70dfa4848bc))
- The Distinction Between Actor and Observer
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I know they're walking meditation and so forth, but it seems like sitting or lying down and perhaps not always but often limiting our visual perception, closing the eyes, directing a mind's eye some place. Is there a dedicated effort toward generating imagery? What are the component parts? And where I'm really going with this is, why would those component parts eventually allow for this disillusion of the fist or the realization that there is no distinction between actor and observer and so on?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, yeah, well, so to answer that second question, first, ultimately meditation is not a practice that you're adding to your life. It's not it's not a doing more of anything. It's actually ceasing to do something. It's ultimately non-distraction. I mean, ultimately you're recognizing what consciousness is like when you're no longer distracted by the automatic arising of thought. It's not that thoughts don't arise. It's not that you can't use them. ([Time 2:08:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fd32b4a3-1269-4625-a890-cc0cb784a427))
- Meditating for Greater Concentration
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  If you have a laser focus to one fixation point, everything else in your visual field begins to fade out. But meditatively, if you have a laser focus on any one thing, whether it's the breath or a candle flame, whatever it is, not only does, let's use the breath for a second because your eyes can be closed. You can lose all sense of everything. You can lose all sense of hearing. Your physical body can disappear. I mean, like literally, it can become incredibly subtle and vast and druglike. And many people approach meditation thinking, kind of climbing the ladder of those changes into subtlety and vastness. That's the whole game. And it can be a deeply rewarding game to play. And it also does come with all kinds of ancillary benefits. I mean, all the focus and the calm and the smoothness of emotional states, I mean, all that comes with greater concentration. ([Time 2:10:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f69eedec-0457-40c8-a714-6aa2761ac385))
- The Art of Observing Thoughts
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Paying careful attention to whatever is arising on its own. Right now, in the beginning, it's natural to take a single object like the breath as a starting point. It's kind of an anchor. But very, very quickly, over the course of even your first week of doing this, people, teachers and various sources of information will recommend that once you get some facility, once you know the difference between being lost and thought and actually paying attention to the breath, well, then you can open it up to everything. You can open it up to sounds and other sensations in the body and moods and emotions and even ultimately thoughts themselves. And so very quickly, you can recognize that thoughts are not intrinsically the enemy to this practice. They are also just spontaneous appearances in consciousness that can be observed. But for some considerable period of time, people will feel that there is a place from which that observation is happening.

- Dualistic and Non-Dualistic Perspectives on the Self
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. No, that's very useful. And that's somewhat adjacent to this distinction I'm making between dualistic and non-dualistic ways of experiencing the world. So even dualistically, everything is still a process, right? And we're misled by the reification that noun talk gives us. So, and this, this applies not just to something like mindfulness, but even to something like the self, right? So the sense of self is also a process. I mean, it's a verb. It's not, it's a word. We're selfing more than we are selves, right? And there are, you know, even appropriate uses ([Time 2:18:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/69f36b50-184d-44cd-bfd7-eac5a86a75f5))
- The Importance of Psychological Integrity
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And you have mastery and virtuosity. And we're developing it very quickly.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. And, but so again, this is a kind of a stark version of that, but everyone has some version of this just in bouncing between talking to their mom and then talking to their best friend and then talking to a stranger and then talking to someone who's very successful, talking to someone who's not very successful. Like all you notice your vulnerability to all of this stuff. And ultimately, what you want is a level of psychological integrity that is truly divorceable from that. Now, I'm not saying you're ever going to get it perfect. ([Time 2:29:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/03782029-3444-4a5e-af5b-d33f43feace5))
- The Judgment of Wrong: How External Distractions Impact Our Experience
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And I think what we're migrating towards here is a set of for most non-intuitive or non-reflexive action steps that revealed to us that in fact we're not wearing the wetsuit. Now you raised one topic which I think is analogous to this wetsuit, which is this notion of distraction. The normally distraction is masking what would otherwise be a better experience of life. I can think of distraction as falling into two different bins. One would be the kind of distraction that is internally generated, like the fact that thoughts arise and pull me down different alleyways and avenues of my brain and my thoughts and my experience. And then the other would be, and that would compete with my ability to really focus on something.

But ultimately, you want to erase this boundary between formal practice and the rest of life such that there's it's just not remotely findable and and and that that's that's achievable.
