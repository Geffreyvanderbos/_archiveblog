## Highlights
- Biddable dogs would not ask “Why?” if they were told to go upstairs and pack their bags, but non-biddable dogs would need more information before they made their choices about whether or not to comply with your request. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp71fj3wambcr5f9hna52nzp))
- If you have a dog who is pre-programmed through hundreds or thousands of years of breeding to be receptive to being told what to do, those methods might get you somewhere. If you have a dog who has only ever been bred to think for himself, you will find yourself beating your head against a wall. *The* *problem is not the dog, but the method used to teach him* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp71v4tzhsc7wj4bhb0m083m))
- Only about 10% of dog training is about training any particular behavior, like sit, down, or come. The other 90% of dog training is about getting your dog in a frame of mind where he is willing and able to pay attention and learn ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp7y3xr26epvgrbg2zqvkbbv))
- The games we play and the way we teach them will fundamentally begin to change the way your dog thinks and prepare him to learn anything you want him to learn ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp7y5wbjqf8eyvfnf8myzs9v))
- Under the Pigs Fly system, whenever possible, we are going to hand the problem over to the dog and give him room to do what he naturally does best—think it out ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp7y6eh9w3w2vz9baw3xkwch))
- Training your dog is like a card game where you hold all the “consequence” cards and your dog holds all the “behavior” cards. Learning the rules of how to get your dog to trade his “behavior” cards for your “consequence” cards is the first step. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp7yk271cnwh9vftdf6pznhg))
- Your goal is to get your dog to start offering to do stuff for you without being asked ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp7ykh7yrdwx7eac0vr1kj43))
- You are going to learn to get your dog to do things in small steps, using only the clicker and some rewards—the ultimate “hands free” training ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp7ym77pnfehs4w7av6sw3ky))
    - Note: Shaping
- Figure out what gets your dog really excited. Get control of those things or activities. Dole them out in exchange for the things you want ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp7ypkg0rk9qmhzk9120y13e))
- Once you go through the first steps, your dog will have pretty good attention, but we want to expand that to attention everywhere, even with monumental distractions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9h4y2x7bg3dxbj1y5c4e2r))
- If the consequence is something the dog likes, the dog will tend to do the behavior again. If the consequence is not something the dog likes, the dog will tend to not do that behavior again ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9h6vtw9mndj2aqx2gbm1cw))
- There are four possible consequences for any action:
  1. Something is added that the dog likes. For example, the dog sits and receives a cookie. This is called **positive reinforcement**.
  2. Something the dog likes is taken away. For example, the dog jumps on you and you turn around and ignore him—attention is taken away. This is called **negative punishment**.
  3. Something the dog does not like is added. For example, the dog gets ahead of the handler and receives a jerk on the leash. This is called **positive punishment**.
  4. Something the dog does not like is taken away. For example, the dog’s ear is pinched until he picks up the dumbbell—picking up the dumbbell makes the pain of the ear pinch go away. This is called **negative reinforcement**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9h8trvvh9p19q08yknd6kk))
- Reinforcement means anything that will tend to increase behavior, and punishment means anything that will tend to decrease behavior ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpafs9a82nvjmff8vest95vt))
- The key concept is that you cannot make any assumptions about what is reinforcing or punishing to your dog. You have to relax and observe how your dog is reacting to things to know what is reinforcing/punishing to him ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpafvszcwph9fz5tv34tv7s0))
- The owner of the easy-to-train dog has a head start on you. Those dogs actually find their owner’s approval to be reinforcing. Your dog, on the other hand, really does not care if you approve of him or not. Before you even get started training, your dog has to want to work.
