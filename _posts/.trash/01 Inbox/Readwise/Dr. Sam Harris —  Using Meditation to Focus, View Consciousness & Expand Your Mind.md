- The Myth of the Second Doorway to Happiness
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Just to come back to just to talk about the myth for a second so they're really what you just enunciated was a kind of a second doorway into this whole project so like the the usual door is through the door of suffering for lack of a better word I mean people feel unhappy in a variety of ways and they get more sensitized to the mechanics of their own unhappiness and meditation is one of the things on the menu the scene that is explicitly built as a remedy for for unhappiness and uh and it is and that's you know I think that's probably the most common path to this but another path is just intellectual interest I mean just wanting to know what's real about the mind subjectively you know in a first person way and and there's there's no contradiction between those two things I'm Motivated by both of them but um you know it's a totally valid doorway into this um there are definitely step functions I mean I would say they're there at least two I mean ([Time 2:56:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/807bf357-b804-4de7-8ab3-f3344781cbd8))
- The Benefits of Mindfulness
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  A mantra or a visualization or society you know those are other passive practice that are more concentration based um and interesting but the the benefit of mindfulness is that very quickly you realize this by definition compatible with all possible experience because you're not artificially contracting your attention down to something you're you're just being aware of the next thing a sight a sound a taste a thought um so the first step function is to very clearly experience the difference between being lost in thought and being clearly aware of any part of experience including thought and to notice the freedom that compared to psychological freedom that gives you right so you can like you're something's made you angry and now you're thinking about all the reasons why you should be angry and have every right to be angry and what you're going to tell that person when You see them and and then you notice you're thinking right and you notice ([Time 2:57:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f59be853-2b35-4b83-9bb4-7d8416d8da12))

  Speaker 1
  Mind uh and you are you are going to be the hostage of that for as long as you'll be the hostage of that you'll have nothing you can do apart from just deciding to you know check out and watch Game of Thrones again for the third time right like like it's just you can divert your attention to something else which is odd you know sometimes a good thing to do but mindfulness even dualistic mindfulness gives you this capacity to just observe the mechanics of this and then get off the ride when you whenever you want so that really is a step function like first there was a time when there was a time before you could do that and then there's a time after which you can do that the other step function is noticing that there is no one who is doing that I Mean this is the non duality the selflessness the the centralness of awareness right the fact that there's no place from which the mindfulness is being aimed but the fact that there's just this open condition in which everything is appearing you ([Time 3:00:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9419e55d-116b-4a65-a6f6-ba4006577425))
- The Second Step: Recognizing That the Consciousness Is Already Without the Ego
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There is just this condition in which everything is appearing right and what you're calling your body again as a matter of experience I'm not saying that we can't have third-person conversations about you know physical bodies in the physical world but as a matter of experience the only body you're ever going to directly encounter as your own is an appearance in consciousness right so consciousness is not in your body what you're calling your body is in consciousness you know visually proprioceptively it's like everything is just appearing in this condition and again you're not aiming that you're not this is not a spotlight that you're aiming at the body or at you know there's just this condition in which everything including anything you could call yourself is appearing and so yeah so that's the second step function is to recognize that this is all this is already True the consciousness is already without this thing you've been calling your ego hoping and you know hoping to to unravel it through meditation ([Time 3:02:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/29f01dcc-53f5-4f24-b8e1-7c65f1afb22a))

- Psychedelics and the Mind
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Doesn't tend to change perception in the way that classic psychedelics do and it's it's it's also serotonergic but it's it's not it has to be in some part differently so then me even LSD and and psilocybin which are much more similar in classic psychedelics both are also serotonergic but they're not merely so and they're they're also different and the higher dose you take of these drugs the more you you know at lower doses everything can kind of seem the same at higher doses they you know they they they begin to diverge and we can talk about the the pharmacology if you wanted to but the I would just say that for many of us certainly for me psychedelics were indispensable in the beginning improving to me that this was the the the first person interrogation of the mind was worth doing you know because you Know I was somebody who at you know age 17 or 18 before I had any real experience with um ([Time 3:09:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7fc64a30-c113-4d2a-a1a6-4cf5af8869eb))

- The False Self
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The self well so so there are different ways in which the sense of self can be eroded or expanded or there's lots of experiences that can still have a kind of center to them but be you know very novel and and transformational um and one can reify those as a kind of goal state right and it's sort of the there's a concept in in Buddhism that I think is useful it doesn't translate well to English or it can set up um kind of false associations in English that that are unfortunate but so there's a concept ([Time 3:30:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ab87ed5d-ce3b-440d-8b72-f4accbaf3860))

- The Effects of Psychedelics on Neuroplasticity
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Really you both both expand your model of what is possible and what is desirable what is normative i mean just what kind of you know what kind of self do you want to be in the world and uh it can also help you cut through things that are inhibiting you you're actualizing any of those possibilities in ordinary waking consciousness i've certainly found that to be the case i mean you raise a really important point which is that um once these learnings take place these understandings take place inside of psychedelic journeys and i do believe they translate to neuroplasticity i do want to um highlight the point for people oftentimes people say you know this mushroom or this uh psychedelic it opens plasticity but of course plasticity has to be directed some ([Time 3:38:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0248a140-1d6f-416e-b777-dd90b45b2a30))

- The Importance of Process in Life
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Us yeah i mean there's one generic answer that i think can be extracted both from the psychedelics and from meditation and just from just thinking more clearly about the nature of of our lives and it's it's to become more process oriented and to and to be more more sensitive to the the marilla the maraj like character of of achieving our goals right now i'm not i'm not against achieving goals i have a lot of goals i've you know i'm you know i'm very busy there are lots of things i want to get done and and i you know i'm i'm as satisfied as anyone to finish a project and but if you look at the time course of all of that you know fulfillment and you there are few lessons everyone i think has to draw one is most of your life is spent in The process right like the like the moment at which the goal ([Time 3:42:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c01be498-3312-400a-8d58-091ccdc0e82b))
