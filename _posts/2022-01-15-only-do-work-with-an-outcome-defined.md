It's senseless to work on something without a clearly defined outcome (not output). We should reject random effort. The 'Why' needs to be answered before anything else.

Our roadmaps need to read *'Increase user engagement'*. As it is a stronger, activating goal to pursue than *'Release shared profiles feature'*.

Every initiative we take are steps towards the prize. The art is in prioritizing expected results.
